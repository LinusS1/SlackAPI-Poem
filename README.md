Poem about the Slack API
I wrote this one day when I was feeling mad at the Slack API

```
Slack API
---------

Oh Slack API how I hate thee,
every time I use you I feel the need to go pee.
ever confusing, ever angering,
how I ever want you to go vanquishing.
How I never know what you return,
as every field in every call I have to relearn.
As if you want me to burn.
view_id? trigger_id? I do not know
it's like this api wants me to go low
